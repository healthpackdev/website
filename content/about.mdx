    Hi my name is Yasin Kadir. I was born in Turkey/Istanbul. I'm currently a student in middle school. 1 year ago I
    started programming with <b>Node.js</b> for write web apps. I mostly use Javascript and Typescript these are my
    favourites. after I learn Typescript I started learn React. For starting I was hate Next.js because at that time it
    was boring. at now I love <b>React</b> and <b>Next.js</b>, thanks for reading good bye.
